#  Library Files

The Browser Phone uses the JavaScripts and or Styles found in this folder. These projects are mostly found on gitHub, and are open source. They have their own license (mostly MIT), please consult with these projects directly if you have any questions. The index.html file in this project will use the CDN hosted versions, so you only need to download these files if you want to create a working off-line version.

**Please remember that if you host your own files, you will need to configure CORS permissions, as the origionator of the request may come from a script file.**
